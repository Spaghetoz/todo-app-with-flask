# TODO App with Flask
A very simple todo app made with Flask in Python where you can login, register, save tasks and delete them. \
It works with a basic sqlite database.

To install the dependencies enter these commands in the command prompt:
```
pip install flask
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
Warning, this app currently doesn't works with SQLAlchemy 2.0 or above, so you need to install it with the following command : 

`pip install SQLAlchemy==1.4.17`
